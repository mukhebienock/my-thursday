    <h1>Life through high school</h1>
    <p>I started my secondary school education 8yrs ago. It was a great achievement to me regurding the kind of background I was
       from. Throughout the four years course in high school, I aspiring to become an <strong>electronic engineer</strong>; dreams I steel wonders
       how and where such greate dreams vanished to.</p>
     <p>In life, people tend to be contraled by what they think, pulled by their passions and directed by their desires. out of all
        over ten subjects, <em>my aspirations directed into finding some subjects easy and interesting</em>. With my inquisitive nature, asked
        anyone who seemed ready to answer me, what were the main requirements for being addimited in an electronic engineering class.
        From what I was told, <strong>physics</strong> and <strong>mathematic</strong> ended up being my favorite and best subjects.</p>
    <p>Untill you realise what your true passion is, you my never find a comfortable path to follow. <strong><em>My love for video games</em></strong>
       is what pulled me to Moringa School years after high school.</p>
