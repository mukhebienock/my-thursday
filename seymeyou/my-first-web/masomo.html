    <h1>My education memories</h1>
    <p>I started schooling about 18yrs ago, that was when I was 3yrs old of age.
       I spent 13yrs learning no skill in specific; just following the overloaded curriculum.</p>
       <p>Being at school learning no specific skill for my early 13yrs was much! much! better than the 2yrs tha followed.
          Not at school just at home. I wasn't really doing nothing but what I was doing added nothing good to my life.</p>
       <p>In a poor village in Bungoma county; western Kenya, the only thing readly available there was alcohol with money
          as the only requirement to get a direct access it; regardless of age. Oh! I just remembered something,
          <ul>
            <li>most people tend to praise you when you are on a wrong path in life.</li>
            <li>life is sweet and quite smooth when you trekking on a distractive path.</li>
          </ul>
          Three years that followed, I think that when I first sat in a class to be taught same applicable skills(taught to teach).
          I strongly agree tha "sometimes, expectation disappoints." being taught to teach turned to be.........!!! I don't know
          what to say it turned up to be.</p>
         <h2>my primary school life</h2>
         <p>At age three, I made the first step to education which was accepting to be taken to school. A 9yrs jouney, wasn't easy
            for me but I struglled through. I was told that 'education is the key to life' and so I put in more effort each new day
            in order to avoid the dangers of being a failure in life.</p>
            <p>At that early age, my mother taught me that challenges in life are to be faced and overcoming them was the only
               option for those determined to succeed in life.</p>
